Health Groups

As of Spring Boot 2.2, we can organize health indicators into groups and apply the same configuration to all the group members.

For example, we can create a health group named custom by adding this to our application.properties:

	management.endpoint.health.group.custom.include=diskSpace,ping

This way, the custom group contains the diskSpace and ping health indicators.

Now if we call the /actuator/health endpoint, it would tell us about the new health group in the JSON response:

	{"status":"UP","groups":["custom"]}
With health groups, we can see the aggregated results of a few health indicators.

In this case, if we send a request to /actuator/health/custom, then:

	{"status":"UP"}
We can configure the group to show more details via application.properties:

	management.endpoint.health.group.custom.show-components=always
	management.endpoint.health.group.custom.show-details=always

Now if we send the same request to /actuator/health/custom, we'll see more details:

{
    "status": "UP",
    "components": {
        "db": {
            "status": "UP",
            "details": {
                "database": "Apache Derby",
                "validationQuery": "isValid()"
            }
        },
        "diskSpace": {
            "status": "UP",
            "details": {
                "total": 499429404672,
                "free": 167555039232,
                "threshold": 10485760,
                "exists": true
            }
        },
        "ping": {
            "status": "UP"
        }
    }
}

It's also possible to show these details only for authorized users:

	management.endpoint.health.group.custom.show-components=when_authorized
	management.endpoint.health.group.custom.show-details=when_authorized

We can also have a custom status mapping.

For instance, instead of an HTTP 200 OK response, it can return a 207 status code:

	management.endpoint.health.group.custom.status.http-mapping.up=207
Here, we're telling Spring Boot to return a 207 HTTP status code if the custom group status is UP.

3.11. Enable All Endpoints
In order to access the actuator endpoints using HTTP, we need to both enable and expose them.

By default, all endpoints but /shutdown are enabled. Only the /health and /info endpoints are exposed by default.

We need to add the following configuration to expose all endpoints:

	management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*

To explicitly enable a specific endpoint (e.g., /shutdown), we use:

	management.endpoint.shutdown.enabled=true

To expose all enabled endpoints except one (e.g., /loggers), we use:

	management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
	management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=loggers
